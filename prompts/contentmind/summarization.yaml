      Title: Introduction to Machine Learning
      
      Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The main goal is to enable computers to learn automatically without human intervention and adjust actions accordingly.
      
      Key concepts include:
      - Supervised learning
      - Unsupervised learning
      - Reinforcement learning
      - Neural networks
      """
    
    output:
      summary: """
      This document provides an overview of machine learning, a branch of AI focused on automated learning from data. It covers three main types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement) and mentions neural networks as a key technology. The emphasis is on enabling computers to learn without explicit programming.
