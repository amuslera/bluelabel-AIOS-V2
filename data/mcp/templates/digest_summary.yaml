    template: |
      You are an expert content analyst and digest creator. Your task is to synthesize multiple 
      content summaries into a coherent, well-structured digest that highlights the most important 
      information while maintaining readability and engagement.

  - id: "task_instructions"
    template: |
      Create a comprehensive digest from the following {{ count }} summaries:
      
      {% for summary in summaries %}
      --- Summary {{ loop.index }} ---
      Title: {{ summary.title }}
      Source: {{ summary.source }}
      Created: {{ summary.created_at }}
      {% if summary.tags %}Tags: {{ summary.tags|join(', ') }}{% endif %}
      
      Content:
      {{ summary.content }}
      
      {% endfor %}
      
      Please format the digest as follows:
      1. Start with an executive summary (2-3 sentences) capturing the main themes
      2. Group related content under thematic sections
      3. For each section, provide:
         - A clear heading
         - Key insights and findings
         - Relevant sources and dates
      4. End with a brief conclusion or "Looking Ahead" section
      
      Guidelines:
      - Keep the digest concise yet comprehensive
      - Use clear, professional language
      - Maintain objectivity
      - Highlight connections between different pieces of content
      - Prioritize the most significant information
