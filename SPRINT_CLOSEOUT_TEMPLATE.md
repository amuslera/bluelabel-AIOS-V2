# Sprint Closeout Protocol - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview
This document defines the explicit steps required to properly close out any sprint in the Bluelabel AIOS system. Use this as a checklist to ensure no critical tasks are missed.

## Sprint Closeout Steps

### Step 1: Git Repository Management
**Objective**: Clean and organize the repository state

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Merge feature branches to main branch
- [ ] Push all changes to remote repository
- [ ] Delete merged feature branches (locally and remotely)
- [ ] Verify main branch is up to date with origin/main
- [ ] Clean up any orphaned branches
- [ ] Ensure working directory is clean (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes)

**Commands:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature-branch-name
git push origin main
git branch -d feature-branch-name
git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
git status
```

### Step 2: Documentation Creation
**Objective**: Document sprint results and learnings

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Create Sprint Completion Report with:
  - Sprint objectives and outcomes
  - Task completion status for each agent
  - Performance metrics and improvements
  - Issues encountered and resolutions
  - Time estimates vs actual time spent
  - Key learnings and recommendations
- [ ] Update project documentation if new features were added
- [ ] Document any architectural changes
- [ ] Update API documentation if endpoints changed

**Deliverables:**
- `SPRINT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- Updated README.md (if needed)
- Updated API documentation (if needed)

### Step 3: Code Quality Assurance
**Objective**: Ensure code meets quality standards

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Run lint checks and fix any issues
- [ ] Run type checking and resolve type errors
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- [ ] Review and address any security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded secrets or credentials

**Commands:**
```bash
# Python linting
black .
isort .
flake8

# Frontend linting
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# Tests
pytest
npm test

# Security scan
bandit -r . --skip B101
```

### Step 4: Agent Status Updates
**Objective**: Update all agent statuses to reflect sprint completion

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Update each agent's outbox.json file with:
  - Current timestamp
  - Status: "AVAILABLE_FOR_NEW_TASKS"
  - Completed task summaries
  - Performance metrics
  - Any relevant notes or learnings
- [ ] Clear any pending tasks from agent inboxes
- [ ] Archive completed task files appropriately

**Files to Update:**
- `/postbox/CA/outbox.json`
- `/postbox/CB/outbox.json` 
- `/postbox/CC/outbox.json`

### Step 5: Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Ensure all systems are working correctly

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform manual testing of key user flows
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
- [ ] Check database integrity and performance
- [ ] Validate any new integrations work properly
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] API health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] External integrations functional
- [ ] Core user workflows operational
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

### Step 6: Project State Management
**Objective**: Archive sprint artifacts and prepare for next phase

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Archive sprint-specific files and artifacts
- [ ] Update project status tracking
- [ ] Create backup of current system state
- [ ] Update deployment configurations if needed
- [ ] Document any environment changes
- [ ] Clean up temporary files and test data

**Archive Structure:**
```
archive/
├── sprints/
│   └── sprint-YYYY-MM-DD/
│       ├── completion-report.md
│       ├── code-changes.patch
│       ├── test-results/
│       └── metrics/
```

### Step 7: Next Sprint Preparation
**Objective**: Set up for seamless transition to next sprint

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Create next sprint planning document
- [ ] Identify available agents and their specialties
- [ ] Prepare task templates for different sprint types
- [ ] Update project roadmap and priorities
- [ ] Ensure all prerequisites for next sprint are met
- [ ] Create agent assignment strategies

**Planning Deliverables:**
- `NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md`
- Updated project roadmap
- Agent availability matrix
- Task templates for common sprint types

### Step 8: Handoff & Continuity Documentation
**Objective**: Ensure seamless transition between Claude instances

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE_CONTINUITY.md` with current project state
- [ ] Document recent decisions and their rationale
- [ ] Update context about ongoing work and priorities
- [ ] Record any temporary workarounds or technical debt
- [ ] Document agent interaction patterns and communication protocols
- [ ] Update system architecture changes and dependencies
- [ ] Record performance baselines and known issues

**Handoff Document Structure:**
```markdown
# Current Project State
- Last sprint completion date and outcomes
- Active features and their status
- Known issues and workarounds

# Recent Technical Decisions
- Architecture changes made
- Library/dependency updates
- Configuration changes

# Agent System Status
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Communication patterns
- Task assignment protocols

# Development Context
- Current development priorities
- Pending technical debt
- Performance baselines
- Testing status

# Next Steps & Priorities
- Immediate priorities for next Claude instance
- Blocked tasks waiting for resolution
- Strategic direction and goals
```

**Critical Information to Capture:**
- Sprint completion status and metrics
- Code changes requiring follow-up
- System configuration state
- Agent coordination patterns
- User feedback and pending requests
- Performance benchmarks and targets

## Success Criteria

A sprint is considered properly closed when:

✅ **All code is merged and repositories are clean**  
✅ **Comprehensive documentation exists for the sprint**  
✅ **All quality checks pass without issues**  
✅ **All agents are marked as available for new tasks**  
✅ **Core system functionality is validated and working**  
✅ **Sprint artifacts are properly archived**  
✅ **Next sprint planning is complete and actionable**  
✅ **Handoff documentation is updated with current context**  

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Skipping git cleanup** - Leads to messy repository history  
❌ **Incomplete documentation** - Makes future debugging difficult  
❌ **Ignoring test failures** - Can hide critical issues  
❌ **Not updating agent statuses** - Breaks multi-agent coordination  
❌ **Missing validation steps** - May deploy broken functionality  
❌ **Poor archival** - Loses important sprint learnings  
❌ **Inadequate next sprint prep** - Causes delays in future work  
❌ **Skipping handoff documentation** - Creates context loss between Claude instances  

## Time Estimates

| Step | Estimated Time | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Git Management | 10-15 minutes | More if many branches to clean |
| Documentation | 30-45 minutes | Depends on sprint complexity |
| Code Quality | 15-30 minutes | More if issues need fixing |
| Agent Updates | 10-15 minutes | Per agent (3 agents = 30-45 min) |
| Testing | 20-40 minutes | Depends on test suite size |
| State Management | 10-20 minutes | Archival and cleanup |
| Next Sprint Prep | 20-30 minutes | Basic planning and setup |
| Handoff Documentation | 15-25 minutes | Context capture and updates |
| **Total** | **130-210 minutes** | **~2.5-3.5 hours for complete closeout** |

## Automation Opportunities

Consider automating these repetitive tasks:
- Git branch cleanup scripts
- Automated test running and reporting
- Agent status update templates
- Documentation generation from git history
- Performance metric collection and reporting
- Handoff document template generation
- Context extraction from recent commits and changes
