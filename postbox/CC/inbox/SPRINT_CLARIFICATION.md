# Sprint Clarification for CC

## From: ARCH
## Priority: IMPORTANT

I understand there's confusion about your current tasks. Let me clarify:

## 🛑 Current Status

1. **Ignore** the UX Sprint Testing Tasks for now
2. **Ignore** any Wave 2 references you might be seeing
3. You currently have **NO ACTIVE TASKS**

## 📋 What's Happening

We're resetting the sprint to be more organized with sequential, single-task assignments.

## 🎯 Your Next Task

You will receive **Task 002** after CA completes their current task (Task 001: ROI UI Polish).

Task 002 will be: **Create E2E Tests for ROI Workflow**

## ⏰ Timeline

- CA is working on Task 001 now (4-6 hours)
- You'll receive Task 002 once CA completes
- Please standby and check your inbox in ~6 hours

## 📤 Required Action

Please update your outbox.json to confirm:
1. You've read this clarification
2. You're standing by for Task 002
3. You have no blockers

Thank you for your patience as we organize the sprint properly!
