## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Make Contact Type & Priority Editable

  - XL: 24px â†’ 28px
  - And proportional increases for all sizes

### 3. Audio Recording UI (Most Requested)
Need to update `AudioUploader.tsx` to add:
- "Record Audio" button alongside "Select File"

- Voice template display during recording

### 4. Multi-File Workflow Support
Update `ROIWorkflowContainer.tsx` for:
