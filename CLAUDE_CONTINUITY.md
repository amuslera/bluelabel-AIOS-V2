   - Implemented background task processing for single file uploads
   - Added WebSocket support for real-time progress streaming

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Redis caching for transcription/translation/extraction operations
   - Parallel processing implementation with smart workflow optimization
   - Database performance indexes for 40-60% query improvement

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Smooth hover transitions (duration-200) across all interactive elements
   - Enhanced visual feedback with pulsing animations and success states
   - Zebra striping with improved contrast and hover effects
   - Consistent 4px grid spacing system throughout

### Library/Dependency Updates
- No major dependency updates in this sprint
- Enhanced TypeScript usage for better type safety
- Continued use of Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

### Configuration Changes

### Task Assignment Protocols  
- **Sequential Sprints**: CA → CC → CB for UI-focused work
- **Parallel Sprints**: All agents simultaneously for larger features
- **Task Templates**: Standardized markdown format with clear deliverables
- **Success Metrics**: Time estimates, completion criteria, quality thresholds

## Development Context

### Current Development Priorities
1. **UI Redesign Initiative** (Next Priority)
   - Comprehensive redesign plan created (`UI_REDESIGN_MASTER_PLAN.md`)
   - Phase 1: Enhanced navigation system (sidebar + top nav hybrid)
   - Phase 2: Complete settings page implementation
   - Phase 3: Data visualization with retro-styled charts

2. **Sprint Management** (Ongoing)
   - Sprint closeout template established (`SPRINT_CLOSEOUT_TEMPLATE.md`)  
   - 8-step process including handoff documentation
   - Standardized checklists and automation opportunities identified

   - Test coverage below 70% threshold (currently 13%)
   - Need more comprehensive unit testing

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - API documentation needs updates for new endpoints
   - Component documentation for UI library
   - Performance monitoring setup guide

3. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint warnings resolved in frontend
