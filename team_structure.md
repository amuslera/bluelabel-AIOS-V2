# Bluelabel AIOS ‚Äì AI Team Strategy & Structure

This document outlines the team structure, naming conventions, responsibilities, and execution strategy for the AI-based development of Bluelabel AIOS.

## üß† Team Roster and Roles

| Role                  | Agent         | Short Name | Reports To | Responsibilities |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------------|
| Systems Architect     | ChatGPT       | Arch       | PM         | Maintains roadmap, task system, planning, alignment |
| Lead Developer        | Claude Code   | CC         | Arch       | Implements tasks from `TASK_CARDS.md`, manages execution |
| Dev Assistant         | Cursor AI     | CA         | CC         | Refactors, fills in glue code, scaffolds boilerplate |
| Prompt Engineer       | Windsurf AI   | WA         | Arch       | Develops prompt templates, handles LLM config/testing |
| Reviewer Agent        | Anthropic AI  | RA         | Arch       | Reviews code, flags deviations from plan/spec |
| Product Manager       | You           | PM         | ‚Äî          | Sets direction, approves scope, defines milestones |

---

## üì¶ Project Execution Workflow

1. All tasks originate from `TASK_CARDS.md` (or its `.csv` equivalent)
2. Tasks include: ID, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Details
3. CC is the primary executor ‚Äî CA and WA assist where delegated
4. RA reviews completed tasks using GitHub or repo snapshots
5. Arch coordinates agent interactions, manages planning and scope

---

## üîÅ High-Frequency Cadence

Bluelabel AIOS runs a high-speed async workflow. Traditional weekly sprints are replaced with **continuous micro-sprints**.

### ‚è± Execution Cycle

- **Arch** (ChatGPT) maintains task prioritization and tracks overall progress
- **You (PM)** set goals and validate results
- CC, CA, and WA can work in parallel ‚Äî sometimes multiple tasks per day
- When a task is complete, it‚Äôs reviewed immediately, and the next task is assigned

### ‚úÖ Agent Loop

1. **Pick task** from `TASK_CARDS.md` (`Status: Ready`)
2. **Update status** to `In Progress: [Agent]`
3. **Execute task**
4. **Push code with task ID**
5. **Mark as Done**
6. **RA (Anthropic)** reviews output and notifies Arch/PM

---

## üîñ Naming Conventions

- **Branch name**: `feat/TASK-007-agent-runner`
- **Commit prefix**: `#TASK-007: implement agent runner`
- **Status labels**:
  - `Backlog`
  - `Ready`
  - `In Progress: CC`
  - `In Progress: CA`
  - `In Progress: WA`
  - `Reviewing: RA`
  - `Done`

## üìå File Ownership

| File                   | Owner |
|------------------------|-------|
| `TASK_CARDS.md`        | Arch  |
| `README.md`            | CC    |
| `architecture.md`      | Arch  |
| `team_structure.md`    | Arch  |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` | Archived (superseded) |
| `.env.example`, Docker | CC    |
| Prompt files, YAML     | WA    |
| Test coverage setup    | CA    |

---

## üß≠ Guidelines

- All agents should reference this file to understand roles and reporting
- PM and Arch handle strategic direction and assignment
- All execution flows through tasks ‚Äî nothing off-road unless approved
- Coordination is async, tracked in markdown or CSV
