# Bluelabel AIOS v2

**Version:** `bluelabel-aios-v2-alpha`  
**Status:** In Development (Official Implementation Plan – May 2025)  
**Author:** Ariel Muslera / Bluelabel Ventures

Bluelabel AIOS (Agentic Intelligence Operating System) is a modular AI agent platform originally built to support the workflows of Ariel Muslera, an angel investor and solo GP. It is designed to scale personal productivity and decision-making using composable AI agents. The system is intended for internal use first, and then will open up to select founders, investors, and builders.

Bluelabel AIOS is a platform for developing, deploying, and orchestrating modular AI agents. It supports content processing, research, knowledge management, and workflow automation using both local and cloud-based LLMs.

## 🚀 Initial MVP: Digest via Email

1. User sends a PDF or URL via email or WhatsApp  
2. The **Gateway Agent** receives and parses the content  
3. The **ContentMind Agent** processes and summarizes it via MCP (Multi-Component Prompting)  
4. Output is stored in the **Knowledge Repository**  
5. A summary digest is sent back via the original channel

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** React (web), React Native (mobile – planned)
- **Backend:** Python 3.10+ with FastAPI
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL, ChromaDB (vector), file storage
- **Event Bus:** Redis Streams (Kafka-ready)
- **LLM Router:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- **Prompt Engine:** MCP (templated, versioned)
- **Containerization:** Docker (Kubernetes-ready)
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Virtual environment support
- (Optional) Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bluelabel/aios-v2.git
cd bluelabel-aios-v2

# Run complete development setup
./setup_dev.sh

# Or manually:
# 1. Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# 4. Start the API server
python3 scripts/run_with_logging.py
# Or: uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# Check if everything is configured correctly
python3 scripts/verify_setup.py

# Quick environment check
./scripts/check_dev_tools.sh
```

### Access the API

- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- Logs: `logs/bluelabel_aios.log`

### Environment Configuration

The system uses `.env` for configuration. Key settings:

```bash
# Enable Redis simulation (no Redis required)
REDIS_SIMULATION_MODE=true

# Set logging level
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Enable debug mode
API_DEBUG=true

# Optional: Configure LLM providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
