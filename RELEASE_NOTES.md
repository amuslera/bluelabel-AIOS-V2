# Bluelabel AIOS – MVP v1.0.0 Release Notes

## Release Summary

This MVP release delivers the core functionality of the Bluelabel AIOS system, focusing on content processing and knowledge management. The system now includes two fully validated agents (ContentMind and DigestAgent) that work together to process, summarize, and generate digests from various content sources. The release includes a robust prompt management system (MCP), a PostgreSQL-based knowledge repository, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. The architecture is designed to be extensible, with clear separation of concerns and well-documented interfaces.
