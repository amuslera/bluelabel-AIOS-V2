## 🚀 Integration Notes for Frontend

### **Batch Upload Implementation**
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));

const response = await fetch('/roi/upload-batch', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
```

### **Recording Implementation**
```javascript
// MediaRecorder API integration
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = async (event) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('audio_data', event.data, 'recording.webm');
  
  const response = await fetch('/roi/record', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
};
```

### **Workflow Merging**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/roi/workflows/merge', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    workflow_ids: selectedWorkflowIds
  })
});
```

- SQL injection prevention
- Input sanitization

### **Performance Considerations**
- Background processing prevents blocking
- Efficient database queries
- Proper pagination
- Resource limit enforcement
